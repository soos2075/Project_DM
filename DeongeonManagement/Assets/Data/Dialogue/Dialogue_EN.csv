,,,,,,,,
,0,Prologue,Bubble,,,0,@Camera::Player::Camera,Well- what should I do now?
,,,,,,1,,…………
,,,,,,2,,I've learned a lot since then but...
,,,,,,3,,Anyway- the key is that I can control the dungeon and...
,,,,,,4,,I just need to attract more people to grow the dungeon- right?
,,,,,,5,,The more people come- the more mana gathers and the more I can do...
,,,,,,6,,I wonder who would come to a dungeon like this but...
,,,,,,7,,Well- should I observe for a day or so?
,,,,,,8,,First- I need to know who's coming to prepare.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,1,Tutorial_Facility,Bubble,,,0,@Camera::Player::Camera,As expected- only a few herbalists and miners are coming.
,,,,,,1,,Of course. What was I expecting?
,,,,,,2,,Actually- I who used to come here every day know best-
,,,,,,3,,That there's not much reason to come to this dungeon...
,,,,,,4,,………………
,,,,,,5,,But from now on- I can create reasons!
,,,,,,6,,Let's start by creating herbs and minerals.
,,,,,,7,,At least some people are coming anyway.
,,,,,,8,,Is there anything else I can do?
,,,,,,9,,If I have time- I should examine the statues.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,2,Tutorial_Monster,Bubble,,,0,@Camera::Player::Camera,But even though they're few- adventurers will come too...
,,,,,,1,,There are occasionally- you know. Apprentice adventurers.
,,,,,,2,,I can't turn away adventurers looking for exploration- treasure- or monsters\with just herbs and minerals.
,,,,,,3,,I might need monsters after all.
,,,,,,4,,Let's try summoning one using the dungeon's mana.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,3,Tutorial_Technical,Bubble,,,0,@Camera::Technical_A::Camera,
,,,,,,1,@Camera::Player::Camera,Was there such a space in the dungeon?
,,,,,,2,,Looks like I could build some useful facilities here.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,4,Tutorial_Egg,Bubble,,,0,@Camera::Player::Camera,!!
,,,,,,1, @Camera::BasementFloor_3::Camera@Skip::2::Skip,
,,,,,,2, @Action::EggEntrance::Action@Skip::2::Skip,
,,,,,,3, @Camera::BasementFloor_Egg::Camera@Skip::2::Skip,
,,,,,,4, @Action::EggAppear::Action@Skip::2::Skip,
,,,,,,5,@Camera::Player::Camera,The teleportation circle is active again.
,,,,,,6,,It would've been nice if it stayed hidden but...
,,,,,,7,,Anyway- I need to be careful not to let this space be discovered.
,,,,,,8,,They'll find it strange and the guild might send an investigation.
,,,,,,9,,One way or another- if I don't finish this contract- I'll be in hot water...
,,,,,,10,@Action::EggMessage::Action,
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,5,Tutorial_Guild,Bubble,,,0,@Camera::Player::Camera,Should I visit the guild?
,,,,,,1,,I might be able to get some helpful information.
,,,,,,2,,But I should be careful not to cause any trouble.
,,,,,,3,,There might be someone who finds me suspicious.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,33,Day3_Event,Bubble,,,0, @Camera::Event_Day3::Camera,So this is the Novice dungeon- huh?
,,,,,,1,,I bet I could become a monster slayer here!
,,,,,,2,,It'd be nice if there were treasures too... I wonder if there are any?
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,83,Day8_Event,Bubble,,,0, @Camera::Event_Day8::Camera,Is this the Novice Dungeon?
,,,,,,1,,Well- for a super rookie like me-\this level of dungeon is a piece of cake.
,,,,,,2,,I'll quickly clear it and graduate from being an apprentice adventurer!!
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,84,Day8_Event_Die,Bubble,,,0, @Camera::Event_Day8::Camera,What's with this dungeon?
,,,,,,1,,It's way more dangerous than I heard!
,,,,,,2,,Something's not right... I need to escape for now.
,,,,,,3,  @Action::Day8_Event_Die::Action @Camera::Player::Camera @Target::Player::Target,……………
,,,,,,4,,Did they go back...?
,,,,,,5,,That was quite a dangerous one for an apprentice.
,,,,,,6,,I hope nothing bad happened? It'd be nice if they don't come back...
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,85,Day8_ReturnEvent,Bubble,,,0, @Camera::Event_Day8::Camera,There wasn't any danger after all.
,,,,,,1, @Action::Day8_ReturnEvent::Action,It's a more useful dungeon than I heard- isn't it?
,,,,,,2,,Sometimes I could come here for training.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,90,Goblin_Appear,Bubble,,,0, @Camera::Event_Goblin_Leader::Camera,Sniff sniff…
,,,,,,1,,I smell something…
,,,,,,2,,The smell of rich resources…
,,,,,,3,,The smell of dungeon mana…
,,,,,,4,,All… mine…
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,91,Goblin_Satisfiction,Bubble,,,0,  @Camera::Event_Goblin_Leader::Camera,Very satisfying…
,,,,,,1,,But there are still more resources…
,,,,,,2, ,I must come back again…
,,,,,,3,  @Action::Goblin_Satisfiction::Action@Camera::Player::Camera @Target::Player::Target,……
,,,,,,4,,They're truly ruthless- aren't they?
,,,,,,5,,Luckily- we seem to have plenty of mana…
,,,,,,6,,Somehow- I think they'll come back again.
,,,,,,7,,But if more come next time- it'll be trouble.
,,,,,,8,,Let's make sure they can't get further into the dungeon.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,92,Goblin_Empty,Bubble,,,0, @Camera::Event_Goblin_Leader::Camera,…Dungeon…nothing special…
,,,,,,1, @Action::Goblin_Pass::Action,Must find…another dungeon…
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,93,Goblin_Die,Bubble,,,0, @Camera::Event_Goblin_Leader::Camera,Ugh…
,,,,,,1, @Action::Goblin_Pass::Action,Dungeon…dangerous…
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,100,Goblin_Party,Bubble,,,0, @Camera::Event_Goblin_Leader2::Camera,They say there are many resources here…
,,,,,,1,,The comrades… have all come together…
,,,,,,2,,Everything… is ours…
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,140,Catastrophe_Appear,Bubble,,,0, @Camera::Event_Catastrophe::Camera,………………………………
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,141,Catastrophe_Return,Bubble,,,0, @Camera::Event_Catastrophe::Camera,That's all for today…
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,142,Catastrophe_Return_First,Bubble,,,0, @Camera::Event_Catastrophe::Camera,That's all for today…
,,,,,,1,  @Action::Catastrophe_Refeat::Action@Camera::Player::Camera @Target::Player::Target,………………………………
,,,,,,2,,We barely made it back…
,,,,,,3,,Oddly- it seems there’s less mana generation- \and it’s not easy to drive them away.
,,,,,,4,,It looks like they might keep coming…
,,,,,,5,,If this continues- \it could end up like the other dungeons- being overtaken.
,,,,,,6,,Is there no way to handle this? \I need to find a solution somehow.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,153,Day15_Event,Bubble,,,0, @Camera::Event_RetiredHero::Camera,My apprentice kept begging to go to the dungeon-\so I sent them to this safe Novice Dungeon
,,,,,,1,,But they came back with quite severe injuries.
,,,,,,2,,I'm sure I remember it being an unremarkable dungeon...
,,,,,,3,,It seemed strange so I investigated-\and there were rumors that recently-\strong monsters have appeared or rare items have been found.
,,,,,,4,,I wanted to check it out myself- so I came.
,,,,,,5,,Well- although I'm retired as an adventurer- this much should be fine.
,,,,,,6,,After all- I was once called a hero.
,,,,,,7,,Shall we go then?
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,154,Day15_Event_Die,Bubble,,,0, @Camera::Event_RetiredHero::Camera,This is definitely dangerous.
,,,,,,1,,Even for a retired pro like me to struggle this much…
,,,,,,2,,This needs to be reported to the guild.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,200,Day20_Event,Bubble,,,0, @Camera::A_Warrior::Camera,We've arrived. This is the quest location.
,,,,,,1, @Target::A_Elf::Target,What? Really?\Such a boring and uninteresting looking dungeon?
,,,,,,2, @Target::A_Warrior::Target,The location seems right...\It's called the [Novice Dungeon].
,,,,,,3, @Target::A_Elf::Target,What's with calling it the [Novice Dungeon]? \It's just your typical newbie dungeon through and through!
,,,,,,4, @Target::A_Wizard::Target,Hmm. As far as I know- it was supposed to be an unremarkable dungeon-
,,,,,,5,,It's quite interesting that a high^grade quest came from such a place.
,,,,,,6, @Target::A_Tanker::Target,The quest content is to survey the entire dungeon and reassess its danger level.
,,,,,,7,,We need to be careful since we don't know much.
,,,,,,8, @Target::A_Elf::Target,You be careful! You can take the hits in front!
,,,,,,9, @Target::A_Tanker::Target,………………
,,,,,,10, @Target::A_Warrior::Target,Calm down a bit.
,,,,,,11,,The guild wouldn't have posted a high^grade quest for no reason.\There must be something.
,,,,,,12, @Target::A_Wizard::Target,I think so too.\It feels like something's about to happen.
,,,,,,13, @Target::A_Elf::Target,...Well- I wasn't saying I didn't want to go in because it's boring!...
,,,,,,14,,Let's just go! Let's go!
,,,,,,15, @Target::A_Warrior::Target,Alright. Everyone- prepare well.
,,,,,,16,,We're going in!
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,201,Day20_Over,Bubble,,,0, @Camera::Player::Camera,That was dangerous.\They were probably the famous 4^person party from the guild.
,,,,,,1,,Did the guild post the quest?
,,,,,,2,,Since we took them down- there will probably be a big commotion.
,,,,,,3,,There's not much time left on the contract-\but I need to prepare thoroughly as we don't know what might happen before then.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,250,Day25_Event,Bubble,,,0,  @Camera::Captine_A::Camera,Attention everyone! \We will now begin the dungeon investigation and suppression operation.
,,,,,,1,,Actions will be carried out in squad units.
,,,,,,2,,The first squad will enter with me-\followed by the next squad.
,,,,,,3,,All monsters discovered are targets for suppression-\report any treasures or artifacts if found.
,,,,,,4, @Target::Event_Soldier1::Target, <size=50>Yes! Sir!
,,,,,,5, @Target::Captine_B::Target,Did everyone hear that? \We'll enter after the front squad goes in and waits.
,,,,,,6,,Everyone prepare and wait.
,,,,,,7, @Target::Event_Soldier2::Target, <size=50>Yes! Sir!
,,,,,,8, @Target::Captine_A::Target,Then- enter!
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,300,Day30_Event,Bubble,,,0,  @Camera::Captine_C::Camera,Fall in!
,,,,,,1,,Due to the failure of the last suppression-\the guild has suffered an unprecedented large loss.
,,,,,,2,,To make up for that- this suppression team has been reorganized.
,,,,,,3,,In other words- failure is absolutely\not tolerated this time.
,,,,,,4,,Everyone- use all your strength to thoroughly investigate\every single monster in the dungeon- down to the last blade of grass.
,,,,,,5,,Be ready to report immediately if you discover any strange places or dangerous entities.
,,,,,,6, @Camera::Captine_A::Camera@Target::Captine_A::Target, <size=50>Yes! Sir!
,,,,,,7, @Camera::Captine_B::Camera@Target::Captine_B::Target, <size=50>Yes! Sir!
,,,,,,8, @Camera::B_Warrior::Camera@Target::B_Warrior::Target,………
,,,,,,9, @Target::B_Elf::Target,Hmph- do you think you can clear this dungeon like that?
,,,,,,10,,Not a chance!
,,,,,,11, @Target::B_Warrior::Target,You've become much more humble compared to last time.\You didn't have to come if you were scared.
,,,,,,12, @Target::B_Elf::Target,I'm not scared!\It's just more dangerous than I thought.
,,,,,,13,,And the guild said I had to come as a witness-\they said there would be disadvantages if I didn't come. So I had to come.
,,,,,,14, @Target::B_Warrior::Target,Well- if it comes to that- I could just go to another guild...
,,,,,,15,,How about the rest of you?
,,,,,,16, @Target::B_Wizard::Target,I want to get revenge for last time.
,,,,,,17,,There might be more interesting things hidden too.
,,,,,,18, @Target::B_Tanker::Target,This time- I'll watch the party carefully.
,,,,,,19, @Target::B_Elf::Target,Sigh- everyone's just a bunch of idiots who want to fight.
,,,,,,20,,Alright- let's go- go.
,,,,,,21,,At least this time- the guild soldiers will lead the way-\so let's just reap the benefits from behind.
,,,,,,22,,If it gets dangerous- we'll run away immediately!
,,,,,,23, @Target::B_Warrior::Target,Alright.\Everyone should know the dangers of this dungeon-\let's go carefully.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,302,Day30_Over,Bubble,,,0, @Camera::Player::Camera@Skip::3::Skip,!!
,,,,,,1,@Skip::3::Skip,Finally... day 30……
,,,,,,2,@Skip::3::Skip,I wonder what will happen now...
,,,,,,3,@Action::Ending::Action,
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,400,Herbalist0_Appear,Bubble,,,0, @Camera::Herbalist0::Camera,Shall I gather some herbs lightly?
,,,,,,1,,It's probably nothing special- but at least it's safe here.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,401,Miner0_Appear,Bubble,,,0, @Camera::Miner0::Camera,I hope there are good ores today.
,,,,,,1,,But it's probably just common rocks anyway.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,410,Elf_Appear,Bubble,,,0, @Camera::Elf::Camera,To think that I- an elf- would come to such a shabby dungeon.
,,,,,,1,,There was a rumor that rare herbs could be found- right?
,,,,,,2,,If it's different from what I heard- I won't let it slide!
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,420,Wizard_Appear,Bubble,,,0, @Camera::Wizard::Camera,I hope there's a good research subject in this dungeon.
,,,,,,1,,It's worthless if it's too trivial- you know.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,501,Opening_1,Bubble,,,0,,………………
,,,,,,1,,Sigh- I want to go on a real adventure too.
,,,,,,2,,How long do I have to stay cooped up in this dungeon?
,,,,,,3,,Everyone else is going to popular dungeons or\dungeons overflowing with resources...
,,,,,,4,,…………Well- who can I blame for my lack of skill.
,,,,,,5,,But at least I know this dungeon inside out. \...It's almost like a second home.
,,,,,,6,,……………………………
,,,,,,7,,Stop talking nonsense and let's pack up and go home.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,502,Opening_2,Bubble,,,0,,Huh?
,,,,,,1,,Why is there a teleportation circle in a place like that...
,,,,,,2,,I've been coming to this dungeon \for years and it's the first time I've seen it.
,,,,,,3,,To think there's a part of this dungeon I don't know about...
,,,,,,4,,I'm curious- should I go check it out?
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,503,Opening_3,Bubble,,,0,,…………………
,,,,,,1,,It feels so out of place.
,,,,,,2,,Did I get teleported to a different dungeon?
,,,,,,3,,I've heard there are sometimes teleportation circles like that...
,,,,,,4,,No- but how could there be such a thing in a Novice Dungeon?
,,,,,,5,,Hmm... There seems to be something written in front.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,504,Opening_4,Bubble,,,0,@Target::Notice::Target,★☆Super Special Rare Chance☆★
,,,,,,1,,You who have mastered this dungeon!!
,,,,,,2,,A once in a lifetime opportunity given to you!!
,,,,,,3,,If you raise the dungeon's rank to A- you'll get!!
,,,,,,4,,Ownership of this dungeon!!\An absolutely unrepeatable lucky chance!!
,,,,,,5,,Do you want to make a contract??\<size=10>※Forced contract if refused
,,,,,,6,@Target::Player::Target,......What's with this scam^like explanation?
,,,,,,7,,Mastering a Novice Dungeon that anyone can clear...
,,,,,,8,,And since when did dungeons have ownership?
,,,,,,9,,Hmm... I've heard of dungeons that charge entrance fees somewhere...
,,,,,,10,,…………It's foolish to think about this seriously.
,,,,,,11,,Is this someone's prank?
,,,,,,12,,But I've never seen a space like this in this dungeon before...
,,,,,,13,,If someone came to play a prank- I should have known...
,,,,,,14,,More importantly- what's that egg in the back?\And what's this about dungeon rank?
,,,,,,15,,How am I supposed to raise the dungeon's rank in the first place?
,,,,,,16,,If there was such a method-\I would have made this dungeon more prosperous long ago...
,,,,,,17,@Target::Notice::Target,Dungeon Master's intention confirmed.
,,,,,,18,,Contract will proceed according to the Dungeon Master's intention.
,,,,,,19,,The period is 30 days and your soul will be collected upon failure.
,,,,,,20,,Well then- good luck!!
,,,,,,21,@Target::Player::Target,What? This is crazy. When did I say I'd do it!!
,,,,,,22,,No!!!!!!!!!
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,600,Ending_Demo,Bubble,,,0, @Camera::Player::Camera @Skip::2::Skip,!!
,,,,,,1,@Skip::2::Skip,!!!!!!!!!
,,,,,,2,@Skip::2::Skip,!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,700,Ending_Common,Bubble,,,0,,Finally- the 30 days of the contract have passed.
,,,,,,1,,A great flow of mana occurred in the dungeon and began to gather in the egg in the room.
,,,,,,2,,Soon- the egg shook and something awakened...
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,711,Dog_1,Bubble,,,0,,What hatched from the egg was a creature that felt somehow familiar.
,,,,,,1,,It explained that it was a being born from the dungeon's mana.
,,,,,,2,,It says it will help me from now on.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,712,Dog_2,Bubble,,,0,,30 days have passed and the contract has ended- but the initial contract terms were not fulfilled.
,,,,,,1,,However- the soul collection mentioned on the signboard did not take place.
,,,,,,2,,Perhaps there was no contract or anything from the beginning?
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,713,Dog_3,Bubble,,,0,,But it's true that I was able to manage the dungeon for 30 days.
,,,,,,1,,I lost the ability to manage the dungeon- and the dungeon returned to being an ordinary dungeon.
,,,,,,2,,As time passed- it gradually became an ordinary Novice Dungeon again-\and when there were hardly any people visiting the dungeon- I too left the dungeon.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,714,Dog_4,Bubble,,,0,,But I'm not lonely. Because I'm no longer alone like before.
,,,,,,1,,Now- beside me- is my best friend- companion- and trustworthy comrade.
,,,,,,2,,I take another step towards the adventure I've been dreaming of today. Forever...
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,990,Expansion_4,Bubble,,,0, @Camera::Player::Camera@Skip::2::Skip@Fade::0::Fade,!!
,,,,,,1, @Action::Entrance_Move_2to4::Action@Skip::10::Skip,
,,,,,,2,@Camera::Player::Camera,Has the location of the teleportation circle leading to this space changed?
,,,,,,3,,I guess it's because the dungeon expanded...
,,,,,,4,,If so- this is quite good news.
,,,,,,5,,As we continue to expand the dungeon-\the risk of this space being discovered will also decrease.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,1000,Quest_0,Bubble,,,0, @Target::Player::Target@Pos::Down::Pos,There are no quests available for gathering information right now.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,1001,Quest_1,Bubble,,,0, @Target::Player::Target @Pos::Down::Pos@Option::1000::Option,It seems there might be a quest about our dungeon.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,1010,Quest_10,Bubble,,,0, @Target::Player::Target @Pos::Down::Pos,I could check quests here.
,,,,,,1,,As a dungeon master- adventurer quests are meaningless now.
,,,,,,2,,But if there are quests registered about our dungeon-\it wouldn't hurt to know.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,1100,Quest_100,Quest,Slime of the Novice Dungeon,0,0,@Action::1100::Action,※Emergency Subjugation Quest\\Target : Mutated Slime in the Novice Dungeon
,,,,,,1,,Rumors are circulating about the appearance of abnormally strong slimes in the Novice Dungeon.
,,,,,,2,,At first- we ignored it as a light rumor- but as actual damage reports are coming in- we are urgently issuing an emergency subjugation quest.
,,,,,,3,,Location : Novice Dungeon\Special Note : Looks like a normal slime but is abnormally strong.\Caution needed.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,1101,Quest_101,Quest,Earth Golem's Core,0,0,@Action::1101::Action,※Rare Monster Information\\Target : Earth Golem
,,,,,,1,,An adult^level Earth Golem has been sighted in the Novice Dungeon.
,,,,,,2,,Golem cores are essential materials for elemental magicians- and alchemists can't get enough of them.
,,,,,,3,,Due to excessive golem hunting- golem cores are currently being traded at very high prices.\\The guild is also buying them at high prices- so please visit the guild if you obtain any.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,1140,Quest_140,Quest,Catastrophe of the Dungeon,,0, @Day::15::Day@,Danger is approaching the beginner's dungeon. \Preparation is needed.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,1141,Quest_141,Quest,The catastrophe continues,,0,,Disasters keep coming. \Find a way to resolve them.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,

,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,2100,Staff_A_100,Bubble,Dungeon Promotion,,0, @Target::Player::Target @Pos::Down::Pos,Recently- there's a rumor about good herbs appearing in the Novice Dungeon......
,,,,,,1, @Action::2100::Action,There's quite a strong monster causing trouble......
,,,,,,2, @Target::Staff_A::Target @Pos::Up::Pos ,Thank you for the information. I'll pass it on.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,2101,Staff_A_101,Bubble,Ask for News,,0, @Target::Player::Target @Pos::Down::Pos,Is there any useful information going around recently?
,,,,,,1, @Target::Staff_A::Target@Pos::Up::Pos,Hmm... Nothing in particular right now.
,,,,,,2,,Please check the bulletin board on the left as well.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,

,3010,Staff_B_10,Bubble,,,0,,Hello. The guild provides things that can be helpful to adventurers.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,3014,Staff_B_14,Bubble,,,0, @Action::1140::Action,Are you heading to the dungeon now?
,,,,,,1, @Target::Player::Target @Pos::Down::Pos,Huh? Well… maybe?
,,,,,,2, @Target::Staff_B::Target@Pos::Up::Pos,Then you should be careful.
,,,,,,3, @Target::Player::Target @Pos::Down::Pos,Is there anything to watch out for in the Novice dungeon?
,,,,,,4, @Target::Staff_B::Target@Pos::Up::Pos,I received urgent information through another guild.
,,,,,,5,,Recently- there have been reports of extremely \dangerous creatures appearing in beginner dungeons.
,,,,,,6,,They reportedly destroy everything- \regardless of adventurers- monsters- or resources.
,,,,,,7, @Target::Player::Target @Pos::Down::Pos,That sounds pretty dangerous.
,,,,,,8,,Is there any way to deal with them?
,,,,,,9, @Target::Staff_B::Target@Pos::Up::Pos,Well…
,,,,,,10,,So far- all we have are reports of people \barely escaping without properly fighting.
,,,,,,11,,Oh- and after these creatures appeared- the dungeon…
,,,,,,12,,Apparently- the mana has been completely depleted.
,,,,,,13, @Target::Player::Target @Pos::Down::Pos,Is that even possible?
,,,,,,14, @Target::Staff_B::Target@Pos::Up::Pos,I only relay what I've been told- \so I don't know the details.
,,,,,,15,,Anyway- I've informed you- so please be careful.
,,,,,,16, @Target::Player::Target @Pos::Down::Pos,Thank you.
,,,,,,17,,(…If it's true- it’s a big problem. \It feels like something major is going to happen.)
,,,,,,18,,(Is there anything I can do?)
,,,,,,19,,(…I should prepare as much as possible.)

,,,,,,4, @Target::Heroine::Target @Pos::Down::Pos,There. You.
,,,,,,5,,Don't just stare- say something.
,,,,,,6, @Target::Player::Target @Pos::Up::Pos,Ah- hello.
,,,,,,7, @Target::Heroine::Target @Pos::Down::Pos,Now you speak?
,,,,,,8, @Target::Player::Target @Pos::Up::Pos,Um- I felt like I shouldn't talk to you.
,,,,,,9, @Target::Heroine::Target @Pos::Down::Pos,What nonsense are you saying?
,,,,,,10,,...Sigh- forget it.
,,,,,,11,,More importantly- \do you know much about the Novice Dungeon?
,,,,,,12, @Target::Player::Target @Pos::Up::Pos,Ah- yes. I go there often.
,,,,,,13, @Target::Heroine::Target @Pos::Down::Pos,Well- I guess someone who looks like \a novice like you doesn't have many options.
,,,,,,14, @Target::Player::Target @Pos::Up::Pos,......
,,,,,,15, @Target::Heroine::Target @Pos::Down::Pos,Then do you know anything about the recent rumors?
,,,,,,16, @Target::Player::Target @Pos::Up::Pos,What rumors?
,,,,,,17, @Target::Heroine::Target @Pos::Down::Pos,Rumors about strong monsters appearing in the Novice Dungeon-\or rare artifacts being found.
,,,,,,18, @Target::Player::Target @Pos::Up::Pos,Hmm... I'm not sure.
,,,,,,19,,Ah- the difficulty might have increased a bit?\Maybe some rare herbs have appeared?
,,,,,,20, @Target::Heroine::Target @Pos::Down::Pos,Did it increase or not?
,,,,,,21,,Can you speak clearly?
,,,,,,22, @Target::Player::Target @Pos::Up::Pos,Well... I don't really know. I haven't gone to the deeper parts...
,,,,,,23, @Target::Heroine::Target @Pos::Down::Pos,Sigh- forget it. It's my fault for asking a novice like you.
,,,,,,24,,That's enough- get lost.
,,,,,,25, @Target::Player::Target @Pos::Up::Pos,……

,6000,Even_0,Bubble,,,0,,Even if it's not for a quest- the guild is also a place for rest.

,,,,,,,,
,9000,Hunter_Slime,Bubble,,,0,@Camera::Hunter_Slime::Camera,Hmmm. The target is... slimes?
,,,,,,1,,A bounty on a slime- that's ridiculous.
,,,,,,2,,I'm going to make a quick kill and go get a drink.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,9001,Hunter_EarthGolem,Bubble,,,0,@Camera::Hunter_EarthGolem::Camera,Is this the place? Where they say an earth golem was spotted recently.
,,,,,,1,,You get what you pay for- they say... \Gotta be the first to find it and cash in big time.

,,,,,,,,
,15010,RetiredHero_10,Bubble,,,0, @Action::1151::Action@Target::Player::Target,Hello. What are you doing?
,,,,,,1, @Target::RetiredHero::Target,Hmm? A novice adventurer- I see.
,,,,,,2,,Just stretching a bit- as you can see.
,,,,,,3, @Target::Player::Target,Huh? Why is a former hero suddenly here…
,,,,,,4, @Target::RetiredHero::Target,Oh- You recognize me?
,,,,,,5,,I didn't think any adventurers would remember me.
,,,,,,6, @Target::Player::Target,How could I not? \You were one of the heroes I admired.
,,,,,,7, @Target::RetiredHero::Target,Haha- I do have a knack for making people feel good.
,,,,,,8, @Target::Player::Target,By the way- what brings you to the guild?
,,,,,,9, @Target::RetiredHero::Target,Let me see… \Do you happen to know about the Novice dungeon?
,,,,,,10, @Target::Player::Target,Yes. It’s a good place for beginners like me.
,,,,,,11, @Target::RetiredHero::Target,Yes- yes. That Novice dungeon.
,,,,,,12,,I have a former apprentice who I trained after retirement.
,,,,,,13,,Although they’re still inexperienced- \they’re not as weak as you might think based on my training.
,,,,,,14,,But this person went to the Novice dungeon \and returned with severe injuries.
,,,,,,15,,I thought such a dungeon would be easily conquered.
,,,,,,16, @Target::Player::Target,Really? Could it be that your apprentice is lying…
,,,,,,17, @Target::RetiredHero::Target,That can’t be. \Even if they’re foolish- they’re not a liar.
,,,,,,18, @Target::Player::Target,But isn’t the Novice dungeon supposed to be very easy?
,,,,,,19, @Target::RetiredHero::Target,That’s precisely what’s strange.
,,,,,,20,,According to my apprentice- it seems like \it’s no longer a beginner’s dungeon.
,,,,,,21,,So- I’m preparing to check it out myself.
,,,,,,22, @Target::Player::Target,I see. \But couldn’t you check that with the guild?
,,,,,,23, @Target::RetiredHero::Target,I did ask them about it.
,,,,,,24,,And indeed- strange reports came in.
,,,,,,25,,So- I decided to check it out myself and let you know.
,,,,,,26, @Target::Player::Target,I see…
,,,,,,27,,When are you planning to go to the dungeon?
,,,,,,28, @Target::RetiredHero::Target,Hmm? I’m planning to go on the 15th.
,,,,,,29,,Why do you ask?
,,,,,,30, @Target::Player::Target,Ah- I was hoping to see a bit of the hero’s prowess…
,,,,,,31, @Target::RetiredHero::Target,Haha- You sure know how to talk.
,,,,,,32,,But I don’t need any help. \It would only be a hindrance.
,,,,,,33, @Target::Player::Target,Understood. Thank you.
,,,,,,34, @Target::RetiredHero::Target,Alright- Take care.
,,,,,,35, @Target::Player::Target,(This is serious. \Even though they’re retired- they were once a hero.)
,,,,,,36,,(If I don’t prepare properly- the dungeon might be conquered.)
,,,,,,37,,(They said the 15th. I should prepare as much as possible.)
