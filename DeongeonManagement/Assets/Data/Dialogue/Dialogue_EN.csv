,501,Opening_1,Bubble,,,0,,……………
,,,,,,1,,Ah- I want to have a real adventure too.
,,,,,,2,,How long do I have to stay in this Novice Dungeon?
,,,,,,3,,Everyone else gets to go to popular Dungeons \or Dungeons overflowing with resources...
,,,,,,4,,...Well- it's nobody's fault but my own lack of skill.
,,,,,,5,,But at least this Dungeon is familiar. \...It's almost like a second home- isn't it?
,,,,,,6,,…………………………
,,,,,,7,,Enough idle chatter- let's pack up and head back.
,,,,,,,,
,502,Opening_2,Bubble,,,0,,Huh?
,,,,,,1,,Why is there a warp gate over there...
,,,,,,2,,In all the years I've been in this Novice Dungeon- \I've never seen that before.
,,,,,,3,,There are places in this Dungeon I don't know about...
,,,,,,4,,I'm curious- should I take a look?
,,,,,,,,
,503,Opening_3,Bubble,,,0,,……………
,,,,,,1,,Something feels off about this place.
,,,,,,2,,Could I have warped to a different Dungeon?
,,,,,,3,,I've heard there are warp gates like that sometimes...
,,,,,,4,,No- but how could that be in a Novice Dungeon?
,,,,,,5,,Hmm... There's something written up ahead.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,504,Opening_4,Bubble,,,0,@Target::Notice::Target,★☆Extremely Rare Chance☆★
,,,,,,1,,You who have mastered this Dungeon!!
,,,,,,2,,For you- a once in a lifetime opportunity!!
,,,,,,3,,If you raise the Dungeon's rank by 5 levels- no less than!!
,,,,,,4,,The ownership of this Dungeon will be granted to you!!\An absolute 'once in a lifetime' chance!!
,,,,,,5,,Will you accept the contract??\ <size=10>※Refusal leads to forced contract
,,,,,,6,@Target::Player::Target,...What is this scam- like description?
,,,,,,7,,A master in a Novice Dungeon that anyone can clear?
,,,,,,8,,And since when do Dungeons have ownership?
,,,,,,9,,Well... I've heard of Dungeons that charge entry fees...
,,,,,,10,,………It seems foolish to take this seriously.
,,,,,,11,,Is someone playing a prank?
,,,,,,12,,But I've never seen a space like this \in this Dungeon before...
,,,,,,13,,If someone came and pulled a prank- \I would have known about it...
,,,,,,14,,And what is that egg in the back?\What does 'Dungeon rank' even mean?
,,,,,,15,,How can I raise the Dungeon's rank in the first place?
,,,,,,16,,If there was a way- I would have made \this Dungeon more prosperous long ago...
,,,,,,17,@Target::Notice::Target,The will of the Dungeon Master has been confirmed.
,,,,,,18,,The contract will proceed according to \the Dungeon Master's will.
,,,,,,19,,The duration is 30 days- and failure will \result in your soul being collected.
,,,,,,20,,Now- fighting!!
,,,,,,21,@Target::Player::Target,What? This is insane. When did I ever agree to this!!
,,,,,,22,,No!!!!!!!!!

,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,0,Prologue,Bubble,,,0,@Camera::Player::Camera,Okay- so what should I do?
,,,,,,1,,……………
,,,,,,2,,After learning all sorts of things...
,,,,,,3,,The gist is that I can manipulate the Dungeon...
,,,,,,4,,And if I get more people to come and \grow the Dungeon- it'll work out- right?
,,,,,,5,,The more people- the more mana will gather- \and I'll be able to do more...
,,,,,,6,,I wonder who would come to a Dungeon like this...
,,,,,,7,,Well- I'll keep an eye on it for a day or so first?
,,,,,,8,,I need to know who's coming so I can prepare.
,,,,,,,,
,1,Tutorial_Facility,Bubble,,,0,@Camera::Player::Camera,As expected- it's just a few herb gatherers and miners.
,,,,,,1,,Well- what did I expect?
,,,,,,2,,Actually- I know this Dungeon best \since I've been here all the time...
,,,,,,3,,There's not much reason to come here...
,,,,,,4,,……………
,,,,,,5,,But from now on- I'll just have to create reasons!
,,,,,,6,,Let's start by creating herbs and minerals.
,,,,,,7,,At least a few people come for those.
,,,,,,8,,Is there anything else I can do?
,,,,,,9,,If I have time- I should check out the statues too.
,,,,,,,,
,2,Tutorial_Monster,Bubble,,,0,@Camera::Player::Camera,But adventurers will come too- even if it's just a few...
,,,,,,1,,I mean- there are novice adventurers sometimes.
,,,,,,2,,I can't just turn away adventurers whose goal is\exploration or treasure- or monsters.
,,,,,,3,,I might need monsters too.
,,,,,,4,,Let me try summoning one using the Dungeon's mana.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,3,Tutorial_Technical,Bubble,,,0,@Camera::Technical_A::Camera,
,,,,,,1,@Camera::Player::Camera,Did the Dungeon always have a space like this?
,,,,,,2,,It seems like I can build useful facilities here.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,4,Tutorial_Egg,Bubble,,,0,@Camera::Player::Camera,!!
,,,,,,1, @Camera::BasementFloor_3::Camera@Skip::2::Skip,
,,,,,,2, @Action::EggEntrance::Action@Skip::2::Skip,
,,,,,,3, @Camera::BasementFloor_Egg::Camera@Skip::2::Skip,
,,,,,,4, @Action::EggAppear::Action@Skip::2::Skip,
,,,,,,5,@Camera::Player::Camera,The warp gate has been reactivated.
,,,,,,6,,It would have been better if it stayed hidden...
,,,,,,7,,Anyway- I need to be careful not to let \this space be discovered.
,,,,,,8,,People would find it strange- \and the guild might investigate.
,,,,,,9,,It would be dangerous for me \if I can't complete the contract...
,,,,,,10,@Action::EggMessage::Action,
,,,,,,,,
,5,Tutorial_Guild,Bubble,,,0,@Camera::Player::Camera,Should I go to the guild?
,,,,,,1,,I might be able to get some helpful information.
,,,,,,2,,But I need to be careful to avoid any trouble.
,,,,,,3,,Someone might get suspicious.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,33,Day3_Event,Bubble,,,0,@Camera::EventNPC::Camera,Here's the Novice Dungeon.
,,,,,,1,,I'll be able to become a monster slayer here!
,,,,,,2,,I hope there's treasure too... Is there any?
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,83,Day8_Event,Bubble,,,0,@Camera::EventNPC::Camera,Is this the Novice Dungeon?
,,,,,,1,,Well- for a super rookie like me\this Dungeon is child's play.
,,,,,,2,,I'll breeze through and graduate from being a novice adventurer!!
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,84,Day8_Event_Die,Bubble,,,0,@Camera::EventNPC::Camera,What is this Dungeon?
,,,,,,1,,It's way more dangerous than I heard?
,,,,,,2,,Something's off... I need to get out of here first.
,,,,,,3, @Camera::Player::Camera@Target::Player::Target,……………
,,,,,,4,,Did I...make it out?
,,,,,,5,,That was a pretty dangerous monster for a novice.
,,,,,,6,,I hope nothing bad happens... Better not go back there...
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,153,Day15_Event,Bubble,,,0,@Camera::EventNPC::Camera,My disciple kept begging to go to a Dungeon- so\I sent them to this safe Novice Dungeon-
,,,,,,1,,but they came back with quite serious injuries.
,,,,,,2,,As far as I remember- it used to be a pretty tame Dungeon...
,,,,,,3,,After hearing some strange rumors lately-\about powerful monsters appearing- \or rare items dropping-
,,,,,,4,,I decided to come investigate myself.
,,,,,,5,,Well- I may have retired as an adventurer- \but this should be a breeze.
,,,,,,6,,I was even called a hero in the past- after all.
,,,,,,7,,Shall we take a look?
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,154,Day15_Event_Die,Bubble,,,0,@Camera::EventNPC::Camera,This is definitely dangerous.
,,,,,,1,,If even I- a former hero- am struggling this much...
,,,,,,2,,I need to report this to the guild.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,302,Day30_Over,Bubble,,,0, @Camera::Player::Camera@Skip::3::Skip,!!
,,,,,,1,@Skip::3::Skip,Already 30 days...

,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,400,Herbalist0_Appear,Bubble,,,0, @Camera::Herbalist0::Camera,I'll go gather some herbs?
,,,,,,1,,It's nothing special- but at least it's safe here.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,401,Miner0_Appear,Bubble,,,0, @Camera::Miner0::Camera,I hope I can find some good ore today.
,,,,,,1,,It'll probably just be common rocks- though.
,,,,,,,,
,410,Elf_Appear,Bubble,,,0, @Camera::Elf::Camera,For an elf like me to come to such a meager Dungeon.
,,,,,,1,,There were definitely rumors of rare herbs here?
,,,,,,2,,If those were just lies- you won't get away with it!
,,,,,,,,
,420,Wizard_Appear,Bubble,,,0, @Camera::Wizard::Camera,I hope this dungeon has good research subjects.
,,,,,,1,,If it's too boring- it's not worth it.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,1000,Quest_0,Bubble,,,0, @Target::Player::Target@Pos::Down::Pos,There are no quests with useful information right now.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,1001,Quest_1,Bubble,,,0, @Target::Player::Target @Pos::Down::Pos@Option::1000::Option,It looks like there's a quest about our Dungeon.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,1010,Quest_10,Bubble,,,0, @Target::Player::Target @Pos::Down::Pos,I should be able to check for quests here.
,,,,,,1,,Quests are meaningless to me as an adventurer now.
,,,,,,2,,But it wouldn't hurt to check if there are any\related to our Dungeon.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,1100,Quest_100,Quest,Slime in Novice Dungeons,,0,@Action::1100::Action,※Urgent Extermination Quest\\Target: Mutated Slime of the Novice Dungeon
,,,,,,1,,Rumors have been circulating about an abnormally powerful slime appearing in the Novice Dungeon.
,,,,,,2,,We initially dismissed it as a trivial rumor- but with actual cases of harm being reported- we are urgently issuing an extermination quest.
,,,,,,3,,Location: Novice Dungeon\Notes: Looks like a normal slime- but is said to be abnormally powerful.\Caution is advised.
,,,,,,,,
,1101,Quest_101,Quest,Earth Golem's Core,,0,@Action::1101::Action,※Rare Monster Information\\Subject: Earth Golem
,,,,,,1,,A mature Earth Golem has been sighted in the Novice Dungeon.
,,,,,,2,,The Golem's core is a material essential for elemental mages- and alchemists have trouble obtaining it.
,,,,,,3,,Due to overharvesting of Golems- the Golem's core is in short supply and trades at a high price currently.\\The guild is also buying them at a premium- so please visit if you manage to acquire one.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,

,2000,Staff_A_0,Bubble,,,0,,Hello there. What brings you to the guild?
,,,,,,,,

,2100,Staff_A_100,Bubble,Promoting Dungeons,,0, @Target::Player::Target @Pos::Down::Pos,There have been rumors of good herbs in the Novice Dungeon recently......
,,,,,,1,,There are quite powerful monsters- so it's been troublesome......
,,,,,,2, @Target::GuildStaff::Target @Pos::Up::Pos,Thank you for the information. I'll pass it along.
,,,,,,3,@Action::2100::Action,
,,,,,,,,
,2101,Staff_A_101,Bubble,Ask for news,,0, @Target::Player::Target @Pos::Down::Pos,Do you happen to have any useful information lately?
,,,,,,1, @Target::GuildStaff::Target@Pos::Up::Pos,Hmm… Nothing in particular right now.
,,,,,,2,,You may want to check the bulletin board on the left as well.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,3000,Staff_B_0,Bubble,,,0,,If you have any business- please see the staff on the right.
,,,,,,,,
,3010,Staff_B_10,Bubble,,,0,,Hello there. The guild provides things that may be\helpful for adventurers.

,,,,,,,,
,5000,Odd_0,Bubble,,,0,,Oh- hello there.
,,,,,,,,
,6000,Even_0,Bubble,,,0,,Even without quests- the guild is also a place to rest.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,9000,Hunter_Slime,Bubble,,,0,@Camera::Hunter_Slime::Camera,Hmm. The extermination target is...a slime?
,,,,,,1,,A bounty on slimes? How absurd.
,,,,,,2,,I'll quickly take care of it and then go drink.
,,,,,,,,
,9001,Hunter_EarthGolem,Bubble,,,0,@Camera::Hunter_EarthGolem::Camera,Is this it? The place where an \Earth Golem was reportedly sighted.
,,,,,,1,,They say the price is calling... \I should find it first and get my share.

,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,200,Day20_Event,Bubble,,,0, @Camera::A_Warrior::Camera,We've arrived. This is the quest location.
,,,,,,1, @Target::A_Elf::Target,What? Really?\This boring and uninteresting dungeon?
,,,,,,2, @Target::A_Warrior::Target,The location seems to be right- but...\It's a dungeon called the [Novice Dungeon].
,,,,,,3, @Target::A_Elf::Target,What's a dungeon called the [Novice Dungeon]?\It's just the Novice Dungeon itself!
,,,,,,4, @Target::A_Wizard::Target,Hmm. From what I know- it was supposed to be an insignificant dungeon-
,,,,,,5,,But for a high-grade quest to come from such a place is quite interesting.
,,,,,,6, @Target::A_Tanker::Target,The quest involves an overall investigation of the dungeon and a reassessment of its danger level.
,,,,,,7,,Since we don't know much- we need to be careful.
,,,,,,8, @Target::A_Elf::Target,You be careful! You can just take the hits in the front!
,,,,,,9, @Target::A_Tanker::Target,........
,,,,,,10, @Target::A_Warrior::Target,Calm down.
,,,,,,11,,The guild wouldn't have just posted a high-grade quest.\There must be something.
,,,,,,12, @Target::A_Wizard::Target,I think so too.\Something seems like it's going to happen.
,,,,,,13, @Target::A_Elf::Target,...Well- it's not like I didn't want to go in because it was boring!...
,,,,,,14,,Let's just go in! Let's go!
,,,,,,15, @Target::A_Warrior::Target,Right. Everyone be prepared.
,,,,,,16,,We're going in!
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,201,Day20_Over,Bubble,,,0, @Camera::Player::Camera,Dangerous.\They must have been the famous four-man party from the guild.
,,,,,,1,,Did the guild issue this quest?
,,,,,,2,,To have taken them down- there's bound to be a huge uproar.
,,,,,,3,,There's not much time left in the contract period-\so we need to be fully prepared for whatever may happen before then.
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,250,Day25_Event,Bubble,,,0,  @Camera::Captine_A::Camera,Everyone- attention! \We will now commence the dungeon investigation and subjugation operation.
,,,,,,1,,Actions will be carried out by squad units.
,,,,,,2,,The first squad will enter with me first-\and the next squad will follow after.
,,,,,,3,,All monsters encountered are targets for subjugation-\report any treasures or artifacts found.
,,,,,,4, @Target::Event_Soldier1::Target, <size=50>Yes!
,,,,,,5, @Target::Captine_B::Target,Did everyone hear that? \We'll wait for the front squad to enter- then enter after.
,,,,,,6,,Everyone- inspect and wait.
,,,,,,7, @Target::Event_Soldier2::Target, <size=50>Yes!
,,,,,,8, @Target::Captine_A::Target,Then- enter!
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,300,Day30_Event,Bubble,,,0,  @Camera::Captine_C::Camera,Form up!
,,,,,,1,,Following the failure of the last subjugation-\the guild suffered an unprecedented great loss.
,,,,,,2,,To make up for that- this subjugation force was reassembled.
,,,,,,3,,That is to say- failure will absolutely not\be tolerated this time.
,,,,,,4,,Everyone- put in your full effort to thoroughly investigate\every monster- every blade of grass in the dungeon.
,,,,,,5,,Report immediately if any strange locations or dangerous beings are found.
,,,,,,6, @Camera::Captine_A::Camera@Target::Captine_A::Target, <size=50>Yes!
,,,,,,7, @Camera::Captine_B::Camera@Target::Captine_B::Target, <size=50>Yes!
,,,,,,8, @Camera::B_Warrior::Camera@Target::B_Warrior::Target,........
,,,,,,9, @Target::B_Elf::Target,Heh- you think you can subjugate this dungeon by doing that?
,,,,,,10,,Not a chance?
,,,,,,11, @Target::B_Warrior::Target,You've become much more humble than last time.\You didn't have to come if you were scared.
,,,,,,12, @Target::B_Elf::Target,I'm not scared!\It's just more dangerous than I thought- that's all.
,,,,,,13,,And the guild said I absolutely have to come as a reference-\that there'll be disadvantages if I don't- so what can I do! I have to come.
,,,,,,14, @Target::B_Warrior::Target,Well- if it comes to that I can just go to a different guild...
,,,,,,15,,How about the rest of you?
,,,,,,16, @Target::B_Wizard::Target,I want revenge for last time.
,,,,,,17,,There may also be even more interesting things hidden here.
,,,,,,18, @Target::B_Tanker::Target,I'll keep a close watch on the party this time.
,,,,,,19, @Target::B_Elf::Target,Sheesh- you're all just idiots itching for a fight.
,,,,,,20,,Right- let's go- go.
,,,,,,21,,But this time the guild swordmen will take the lead-\so let's just take what we can from behind.
,,,,,,22,,We'll run away right away if it gets dangerous!
,,,,,,23, @Target::B_Warrior::Target,Okay.\Everyone knows the danger of this dungeon-\so let's go carefully.

,,,,,,,,
,700,Ending_Common,Bubble,,,0,,Finally- the 30 day contract period has passed.
,,,,,,1,,A large flow of mana occurred in the dungeon and began gathering into the egg in the room.
,,,,,,2,,Soon- the egg started shaking and something awoke from it...
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,,
,711,Dog_1,Bubble,,,0,,What awoke from the egg was a life form that somehow felt familiar.
,,,,,,1,,It explained that it was a being born from the dungeon's mana.
,,,,,,2,,It said it would help me from now on.
,,,,,,,,
,712,Dog_2,Bubble,,,0,,30 days have passed and the contract has ended- but the original contract terms were not fulfilled.
,,,,,,1,,However- the soul retrieval written on the signboard did not occur.
,,,,,,2,,Could it be that there was no contract or anything from the beginning?
,,,,,,,,
,713,Dog_3,Bubble,,,0,,But it was true that I was able to manage the dungeon for those 30 days.
,,,,,,1,,I lost the ability to manage the dungeon- and the dungeon returned to being a normal dungeon.
,,,,,,2,,As time passed- it gradually became an ordinary Novice Dungeon again-\and when there were almost no more visitors- I too left the dungeon.
,,,,,,,,
,714,Dog_4,Bubble,,,0,,But I'm not lonely. Because I'm no longer alone like before.
,,,,,,1,,By my side now is my closest friend- my companion- my trustworthy colleague.
,,,,,,2,,Today too- I take a step towards the adventure I've dreamed of. Forever and ever...
